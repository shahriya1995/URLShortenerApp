# URLShortener
# Short URL Management System

This system provides an HTTP-based RESTful API for managing short URLs and redirecting clients, similar to services like bit.ly or goo.gl.

## System Overview
The system consists of the following components:
1. API Server: Handles API requests for shortening URLs, redirecting short URLs, and retrieving access counts.
2. Database: Stores mappings between short URLs and long URLs, as well as access count data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MongoDB
- Flask (Python package)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have docker installed.
3. docker-compose build 
4. docker-compose up

## API Endpoints
- `POST /shorten`: Shorten a long URL.
- `GET /<short_code>`: Redirect a short URL to the corresponding long URL.
- `GET /<short_code>/access_counts/` Retrieve access counts for a short URL.

## Testing
- Use Postman/ curl to test endpoints

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
1. We use MongoDB for persistence due to its scalability and performance.
2. Short URLs are generated by random 6-character string using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits to ensure uniqueness and reduce discoverability.
4. Redirecting short URLs is designed to be performed within 10 ms.
