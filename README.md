# URLShortener
This system provides an HTTP-based RESTful API for managing short URLs and redirecting clients, similar to services like bit.ly or goo.gl. A simple URL shortener service built using Flask and MongoDB.

## System Overview
The system consists of the following components:
1. API Server: Handles API requests for shortening URLs, redirecting short URLs, and retrieving access counts.
2. Database: Stores mappings between short URLs and long URLs, as well as access count data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MongoDB
- Flask (Python package)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahriya1995/URLShortenerApp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    ```
3. Running on port - 8080


## API Endpoints
- `POST /shorten`: Shorten a long URL.
- `GET /<short_code>`: Redirect a short URL to the corresponding long URL.
- `GET /<short_code>/access_counts/` Retrieve access counts for a short URL.

## Testing [Postman or CURL to test the app]
- Use Postman/ curl to test endpoints
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://google.com"}' http://localhost:8080/shorten
    ```
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/NBoW08
    ```
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/NBoW08/access_counts
    ```

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
1. We use MongoDB for persistence due to its scalability and performance.
2. Short URLs are generated by random 6-character string using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits to ensure uniqueness and reduce discoverability.
4. Redirecting short URLs is designed to be performed within 10 ms.
